===================

Project developed for IST, Engenharia de Software course

Project about creating a portal that does the management of restaurants and their respective managers, client, products and purchases. Including a website that stores information persistently in a database (Using GWT and, FénixFramework and SQL).

Created by: Alexandre Pimentel, Filipe Bento, Filipe Apolinário, Lucas Silva, Hugo Martins and myself (André Pires).


Note: The project's remote capabalities depend on launching two Web Services done by two separate teams for the Distributed Systems course, the code present in my GitHub only corresponds to the part my team created (Registo Fatura).
